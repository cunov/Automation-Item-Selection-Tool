# Automation-Item-Selection-Tool

This was my summer intern project at Walmart's Logistic Engineering in 2016. I was told it was mine to keep and do with as I please as there is no PII or mission-critical data in it, which I hope is still the case.

The most interesting part of it is a 3-D bin packing function, which aims to limit the different orientations of boxes so to make importing items quick and less laborious for the workers. Excel was the desired format, so that's why it is in VBA.
